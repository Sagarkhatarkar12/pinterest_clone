Pinterest Hero Section Project
ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
HTML Structure: Built a simple and clean layout with a navigation bar and hero section.

CSS Skills:

Transform (translateY) to move images up and down for dynamic layout.

Transition & Animation (@keyframes fade-on) for smooth appearance effects.

Flexbox & Grid to align and arrange multiple images responsively.

Created buttons with hover and active effects.

Media Queries (can be added later for mobile responsiveness).

JavaScript Skills:

Query Selectors to select and manipulate elements dynamically.

Dynamic Text and Color Change of headings (heading_change.innerText, heading_change.style.color).

Dynamic Image Update inside the gallery.

Used setInterval() to auto-slide images and headings every 5 seconds.

Re-triggered CSS animation manually by resetting element.style.animation.

Used offsetWidth trick to restart animation on content change.

Updated button color dynamically based on the current slide.

ðŸ“š Key Concepts Used
setInterval()

querySelectorAll() and forEach()

style.animation and offsetWidth trick

transform: translateY()

@keyframes for fade effects

Dynamic class handling (classList.add, classList.remove)

Clean folder structure (assets, style, script)

ðŸ”¥ Bonus Learnings
Performance Optimization by not loading all images again â€” just changing the src attribute.

Delay Animation using animation-delay for staggered entrance effects.
